"The thing about happiness is that you only know you had it when it's gone. I 
mean, you may think to yourself that you're happy. but you don't really believe it. you focus on the petty bullshit,or the next job, or whatever. it's only looking back by comparison with what comes after that you really understand, that's what happiness felt like." -Kellog from fallout 4
